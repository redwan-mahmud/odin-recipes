    <p>Pad Thai is stir-fry dish made with rice noodles, shrimp, chicken, or tofu, peanuts, a scrambled egg and bean sprouts. The ingredients are sautéed together in a wok and tossed in a delicious pad thai sauce. It’s common street food in Thailand and one of the most popular menu items at Thai restaurants around the country.</p>
    <h2>Unordered List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>5 tbsp light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sriracha hot sauce (or to taste)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp creamy peanut butter (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, until tender. Rinse under cold water.</li>
        <li>Mix the sauce ingredients together. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 tbsp of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.</li>
        <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.</li>
        <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.</li>
        <li>Top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</li>
